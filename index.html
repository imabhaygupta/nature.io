                       The animal in the image is a moose, the largest member of the deer family. Moose are typically found in northern forests of North America, Europe, and Asia, often near rivers and wetlands. Males grow large, broad antlers each year, which they shed in winter. They are herbivores, feeding on leaves, twigs, bark, and aquatic plants. Moose are solitary by nature and are also strong swimmers.

                       Moose are large, solitary herbivores found in northern forests. They are known for their impressive antlers, which only males grow and shed annually. Moose prefer habitats near lakes, rivers, and wetlands where they feed on vegetation. Despite their size, they are strong swimmers and can move swiftly through dense forest terrain.

                        Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their long trunks, large ears, and tusks. They are highly intelligent and social creatures, living in groups called herds. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, grasping objects, and communicating. They are herbivores and spend much of their day eating grass, leaves, fruits, and bark. Found mainly in Africa and Asia, elephants play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.

                        Leopards are powerful and agile big cats known for their distinctive golden coat with black rosettes. They are solitary and elusive predators, often active at night. Leopards are excellent climbers and often drag their prey into trees to avoid scavengers. They are highly adaptable and found in various habitats across Africa and parts of Asia, including forests, grasslands, and mountains.

                        These cows are well adapted to cold climates, thanks to their thick double-layered coat. They are usually reddish-brown, though they can also be black, yellow, white, or brindle. Highland cows are known for their gentle temperament and hardiness. They graze on rough, mountainous terrain and are valued for their lean, flavorful beef.
